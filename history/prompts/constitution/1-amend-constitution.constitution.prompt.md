## Prompt

Create governing principles for an educational documentation project using Docusaurus. Prioritize clarity, technical accuracy, logical progression, engaging explanations, inclusive language, proper Markdown/MDX formatting, code examples with explanations, diagrams for complex concepts (e.g., ROS nodes, URDF, simulation setups), sidebar navigation, and search functionality. Ensure content is suitable for students applying AI to humanoid robots in simulated and real environments. Deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution for the AI-Humanoid Robotics Documentation project with the following key sections:

1. Core Principles:
- Clarity and Accessibility
- Technical Accuracy and Validation
- Logical Progression and Learning Path
- Engaging Educational Content
- Inclusive Language and Universal Design
- Visual Communication and Diagrams

2. Technical Standards:
- Markdown/MDX Formatting and Structure
- Navigation and Search Optimization
- Code Examples with Explanations
- Deployment and Maintenance Standards

3. Development Workflow:
- Content Creation Process
- Quality Assurance
- Collaboration Standards

4. Governance section outlining constitutional authority and amendment procedures.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive constitution for educational documentation project focusing on AI-humanoid robotics education
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (documentation task)
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with new principles
- 🔁 Next prompts: Project is now governed by new constitution for documentation standards
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution addresses all requested aspects including Docusaurus, educational content, ROS concepts, and GitHub Pages deployment

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin creating documentation content following the new constitution
