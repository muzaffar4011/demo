# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence. In this module, you'll learn about creating digital twins for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity, including physics simulation, collision detection, and sensor integration.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept and importance of digital twins in robotics
- Set up physics simulations with accurate collision detection
- Implement high-fidelity rendering for realistic visualization
- Integrate various sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) in simulation
- Configure simulation environments for humanoid robot testing

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical system that can be used for simulation, testing, and validation before deploying to real hardware. In humanoid robotics, digital twins are essential for:
- Testing robot behaviors in safe virtual environments
- Validating control algorithms without risk of hardware damage
- Generating synthetic training data for AI systems
- Prototyping robot designs and interactions

This module focuses on two primary simulation environments: Gazebo, which is tightly integrated with ROS and widely used in robotics research, and Unity, which provides high-fidelity graphics for more realistic visualization and human-robot interaction studies.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (forces, collisions, gravity)
- Familiarity with 3D coordinate systems and transformations

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several lessons:
- Physics simulation: Understanding how simulated physics works
- Collision detection: Implementing accurate collision models
- Rendering: Creating realistic visual representations
- Sensors: Simulating various robot sensors in virtual environments

Let's begin by exploring physics simulation in robotic environments.
