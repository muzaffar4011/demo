# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence. This course bridges the gap between digital AI and physical bodies, teaching you how to design, simulate, and deploy intelligent humanoid robots with natural interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## What You'll Learn

This course is structured into four comprehensive modules:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Master nodes, topics, services, bridging Python agents via rclpy, and creating humanoid robot models with URDF.

2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Understand physics simulation, collisions, high-fidelity rendering, and sensor integration including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs.

3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)**: Explore Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS for VSLAM/navigation, and Nav2 for bipedal path planning.

4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Implement voice-to-action systems using OpenAI Whisper and LLM cognitive planning for natural language commands.

## Target Audience

This course is designed for:
- Students with basic programming knowledge wanting to learn about embodied intelligence
- Robotics developers seeking to understand digital twin simulation
- AI engineers interested in NVIDIA Isaac integration
- Researchers working on voice-controlled humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Interest in AI and robotics applications

## Learning Path

Each module builds upon the previous one, following a structured learning path from foundational concepts to advanced applications. You can follow the modules sequentially for a complete learning experience, or jump to specific modules based on your interests and needs.
