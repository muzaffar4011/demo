# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence. In this module, you'll explore NVIDIA Isaac for creating intelligent robot behaviors, including visual SLAM, navigation, and bipedal path planning.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem for robotics AI
- Implement Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Use Isaac ROS for visual SLAM and navigation tasks
- Configure Nav2 for bipedal path planning in humanoid robots
- Integrate AI perception and planning systems with humanoid robotics

## Overview

NVIDIA Isaac is a comprehensive platform for developing AI-powered robots. It combines:
- **Isaac Sim**: High-fidelity simulation environment for testing and training
- **Isaac ROS**: Collection of ROS 2 packages for perception, navigation, and manipulation
- **Isaac Lab**: Framework for robot learning and simulation
- **Omniverse**: Platform for creating and simulating complex environments

For humanoid robotics, Isaac provides the AI "brain" that enables:
- Real-world perception and understanding
- Intelligent navigation and path planning
- Complex manipulation and interaction
- Learning from simulation to real-world deployment

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2 (ROS 2 and Digital Twin)
- Basic understanding of AI and machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with Docker containers (for Isaac deployment)

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several lessons:
- Isaac Sim: Creating photorealistic simulation environments
- Isaac ROS: Implementing perception and navigation systems
- Nav2 for bipedal robots: Adapting navigation for humanoid locomotion
- AI integration: Connecting perception, planning, and control systems

Let's begin by exploring Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation.
