# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence. In this module, you'll learn about the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for robotic applications.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes for communication
- Implement topics and services for inter-process communication
- Bridge Python agents using rclpy
- Create humanoid robot models using URDF

## Overview

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. In this module, we'll focus on ROS 2, the next generation of ROS with enhanced features for security, real-time performance, and multi-robot systems.

ROS 2 is particularly important for humanoid robotics as it provides the communication infrastructure that allows different components of the robot to work together seamlessly. From sensor data processing to actuator control, ROS 2 enables the distributed nature of robotic systems.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several lessons:
- ROS nodes: The basic building blocks of ROS 2 systems
- Topics and services: Communication patterns in ROS 2
- rclpy bridge: Connecting Python agents to ROS 2
- URDF for humanoids: Creating robot models for humanoid robots

Let's begin by exploring ROS nodes, the fundamental building blocks of any ROS 2 system.
